# Free Food Donation Website

This project aims to connect food donors (restaurants, kitchens, individuals) with food receivers (NGOs, shelters, community centers) to facilitate the distribution of surplus food and combat hunger.

# How It Works

## 1.Donation Entry:

            Food donors register and add listings on the website, specifying the available quantity of food and pick-up time (including AM/PM indication). Optionally, donors can provide additional details like dietary restrictions.

## 2.Browsing and Selection:

            Food receivers register and can browse available food donations based on location, category, or other relevant criteria. They can directly contact donors with any questions or clarifications.

## 3.Pickup Coordination:

            Food receivers plan pickups based on listed details and coordinate directly with donors (optional communication feature could be added).

## 4.Feedback (Optional):

            Both food donors and receivers can provide feedback to enhance the platform's effectiveness and build trust within the community (optional feature).

# Technology Stack

## Frontend:

### React JS:

            Modern JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

### TypeScript:

            Superset of JavaScript adding optional static typing for enhanced developer experience and code maintainability.

## Testing:

### Jest:

            Popular JavaScript testing framework for writing unit tests and ensuring UI component behavior.

### Karate:

            Open-source framework for API testing and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style testing.

## Backend:

### Java:

            Versatile programming language for building robust backend services.

### Maven:

            Build automation tool to manage dependencies, compile Java code, and package the application.

## Database and Cloud Services:

### AWS (Amazon Web Services):

            Cloud platform offering various services for scalable and reliable infrastructure:

### Amazon DynamoDB (or other suitable database):

            NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval of food donation listings.

### S3 (or other suitable storage service):

            Cloud storage for hosting images or other media associated with food donations (optional).

### Lambda Functions (or other suitable serverless services):

            Serverless compute service for handling various backend tasks like sending notifications or triggering actions as needed (e.g., email or SMS reminders to food receivers).

## Getting Started (For Developers)

### Prerequisites:

            Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your development machine. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for backend development.

### Clone the Repository:

            Use Git to clone the project repository.

### Development Setup:

            Follow instructions within the project codebase for setting up the development environment, configuring dependencies, and running the application locally. This may involve commands like npm install (or yarn install) for frontend dependencies, and configuring environment variables for AWS connection details.
